## Assignment 11

This is a sample project framework that demonstrates inheritance and polymorphism. There is a brief demonstration of inheritance and polymorphism in the main class, with explanations in the notes of the code. There are two interfaces, Store and Product, in their own packages. Every class is an offshoot of one of those.The store interface makes the five store classes in pkg2 override its method setLocation(). Each class that implements store also has protected and private variables, and public constructors and methods. Each class in pkg2 is final. The methods also demonstrate overloading, each one overloads a method in it. Each abstract class in pkg1 overrides the method established in interface product in pkg4. Each of the five abstract classes in pkg1 are also a superclass for a subclass that extends it, and each subclass overrides a method from its superclass. Each class in pkg1 has private, protected, and public members.
